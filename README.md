**_To Do List_ is an app that helps you organize your tasks better.**

## Functionalities

#### Page 'Cadastro' and 'Login'
- User can register and login;
- There is a check with the database, where all users are registered;
- I created a reusable page where depending on {{ $route.name }} the title and error message change;
- If the user isn't registered, an error message indicates they need register through the link;
- And if the user is registered, he is directed to the To Do List;


#### Page "To Do list"
- the user can annotate their tasks and these tasks are saved in the database;
- The user can modified, delete and complete their tasks;
- The user can filter between tasks done, undone and all;
- The Data is stored in a database and saved even when the user leaves the page;
